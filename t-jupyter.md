# Jupyter Lab

## TL;DR

```bash
./infra-jupyter.yml # install jupyter on meta node on port 8888 with user jupyter and password pigsty
./infra-jupyter.yml -e jupyter_port=8887 # use another port 8887 by default
./infra-jupyter.yml -e jupyter_username=osuser_jupyter jupyter_password=pigsty2 # use another password
```

Jupyter Lab is a complete data science R&D env based on IPython Notebook for data analysis and visualization. It is currently an optional Beta feature and is only enabled in the demo by default.

Because JupyterLab provides a Web Terminal feature, it is recommended to use [`infra-jupyter`](p-infra.md#infra-jupyter) to deploy it manually on the meta node.


### Default Values

```yaml
jupyter_username: jupyter       # os user name, special names: default|root (dangerous!)
jupyter_password: pigsty        # default password for jupyter lab (important!)
jupyter_port: 8887              # default port for jupyter lab
```


### `jupyter_port`

Jupyter server listen port, type: `int`, level: G, default value: `8888`.



When JupyterLab is enabled, Pigsty will run the local Notebook server using the user-specified by the [`jupyter_username`](#jupyter_username) parameter.

In addition, you need to make sure that the config [`node_packages_meta_pip`](v-nodes.md#node_packages_meta_pip) parameter contains the default value `'jupyterlab'`.

JupyterLab can be accessed by navigating from the Pigsty home page or through the default domain `lab.pigsty`, and listens on port 8888.


### `jupyter_username`

The OS user used by Jupyter, type: `bool`, level: G, default value: `"jupyter"`.

The same goes for other usernames, but the particular username `default` will run Jupyter Lab with the user currently running the installation (usually admin).



### `jupyter_password`

Password for Jupyter Lab, type: `bool`, level: G, default value: `"pigsty"`.

If Jupyter is enabled, it is highly recommended to change this password. Salted and obfuscated passwords are written to `~jupyter/.jupyter/jupyter_server_config.json` by default.



## Jupyter Playbook

### `infra-jupyter`

Playbook [`infra-jupyter.yml`](https://github.com/Vonng/pigsty/blob/master/infra-jupyter.yml) will install JupyterLab on the meta node.

It's a handy data analysis IDE for python. It's also risky because of its web shell functionality. So it's disabled by default. And enabled only in the Demo environment.

Refer to [Config: Jupyter](#JUPYTER-Config) for configuring Jupiter, then execute this playbook.

!>  If Jupyter is enabled in the production environment, be sure to change the password of Jupyter.
