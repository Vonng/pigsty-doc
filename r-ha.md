# HA Scenarios

You can strengthen your confidence in the cluster's HA capability through a HA scenario experiment.

Below is a list of 24 typical HA failure scenarios, divided into three categories: Primary failure, Replica failure, and DCS failure, with eight specific scenarios in each category.

All experiments assume that **HA auto-switchover mode** is enabled, where Patroni should correctly handle Primary and Replica failures.

-----------------------



## Environment

The following is a walkthrough of a local Pigsty four-node sandbox.

**Prepare load**

In the experiment, you can use `pgbench` to generate virtual loads and observe the state of load traffic under various failures.

```bash
make test-ri     # Initialize the pgbench table in the pg-test cluster
make test-rw     # Generate pgbench write traffic
make test-ro     # Generate pgbench read-only traffic
```

If you wish, you can directly adjust the load generation commands and execute them if you want to emulate other traffic styles.

```bash
# 4 connections, total 64 read/write TPS
while true; do pgbench -nv -P1 -c4 --rate=64 -T10 postgres://test:test@pg-test:5433/test; done

# 8 connections, total 512 read-only TPS
while true; do pgbench -nv -P1 -c8 --select-only --rate=512 -T10 postgres://test:test@pg-test:5434/test; done
```

**Observation Status**

The [PGSQL Cluster](http://demo.pigsty.cc/d/pgsql-cluster/pgsql-cluster?orgId=1&var-cls=pg-test&var-primary=pg-test-1) panel provides important monitor information about the `pg-test` cluster. You can review the last 5-15 minutes of metrics and automatically set it to refresh every 5 seconds.

Pigsty's monitor metrics collection period is 10 seconds by default, while the typical time taken for Patroni Primary-Replica switchover is usually between a few and a dozen seconds. You can use `patronictl` to obtain sub-second observation accuracy.

```bash
pg list pg-test          # View pg-test cluster status (in a separate window)
pg list pg-test -w 0.1   # View pg-test cluster status, refreshed every 0.1s
```

You can open four Terminal windows for.

* Execute admin commands on the meta node (the command used to trigger a simulated failure).
* Initiate and observe read and write request loads (`pgbench`).
* Initiate and observe read-only request load (`pgbench --select-only`).
* Real-time access to cluster Primary-Replica status (`pg list`).



## Primary Failure

### 1A-Primary Node Down

**Operating Instructions**

```bash
ssh 10.10.10.3 sudo reboot    # Reboot the pg-test-1 Primary node directly (VIP points to the actual Primary node)
```

**Operation results**

Patroni can handle the Primary node downtime, typically performing automatic Failover.

Manual intervention is required when the cluster is in maintenance mode (manual execution of `pg failover <cluster>`).

### 2A-Primary Postgres Process Shutdown

**Operating Instructions**

Two different ways to shut down the Primary Postgres instance: regular `pg_ctl` and brute-force `kill -9`.

```bash
# Shut down the Postgres Primary process on the mater node
ssh 10.10.10.3 'sudo -iu postgres /usr/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /pg/data stop'

# Query the Primary PID and force a Kill
ssh 10.10.10.3 'sudo kill -9 $(sudo cat /pg/data/postPrimary.pid | head -n1)'
```

**Operation results**

After shutting down Postgres, Patroni tries to pull up the Postgres process again. If successful, the cluster returns to normal.

If the PostgreSQL process cannot be pulled up correctly, the cluster will automatically Failover.

### 3A-Primary Patroni Process Shutdown

**Operating Instructions**

```bash
# Shut down the Postgres Primary process on the Primary node
ssh 10.10.10.3 'sudo systemctl stop patroni'
```

**Operation results**

Shutting down the Primary Patroni commonly **causes the PostgreSQL instances managed by Patroni to shut down together** and **immediately** trigger a cluster Failover.

Shutting down Patroni in maintenance mode normally, shutting down Patroni does not affect the managed PostgreSQL instances, which can restart Patroni to reload the config (e.g., change the DCS used).

### 4A-Primary Node Patroni process abnormally shut down

!> This situation requires special attention!

Suppose you use Kill -9 to kill the Primary Patroni forcibly. In that case, there is a high probability that the Primary Patroni will not be able to shut down the managed PostgreSQL Primary instances. This will cause the original Primary PostgreSQL instance to survive Patroni's death. At the same time, the remaining Replica nodes in the cluster will hold a leadership election to elect a new Primary, **leading to a split-brain**.

**Operating Instructions**

```bash
# Shutting down the Patroni Primary process on the Primary node
ssh 10.10.10.3 "ps aux | grep /usr/bin/patroni | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'"
ssh 10.10.10.3 'sudo kill -9 723'

**Operation results**

This operation may cause a cluster split-brain: because Patroni dies violently and cannot kill the PostgreSQL process it manages. Instead, the other cluster members elect a new Primary node after the TTL timeout.

If you use the standard load balancing health check-based service [access](c-service#access) mechanism, **there will be no problem** because the original Primary node Patroni is dead, and the health check is false. The LB will not distribute traffic to this instance even if that Primary is alive. However, if you continue to write to this Primary by other means, **you may have a split-brain!**

Patroni uses the Watchdog mechanism to underwrite this situation, which you need to use as appropriate (parameter [`patroni_watchdog_mode`](v-pgsql.md#patroni_watchdog_mode)). When watchdog is enabled, if the original Primary cannot shut down the PG Primary in time to avoid split-brain in Failover for various reasons (Patroni crash, machine load fake death, VM scheduling, PG shutdown too slow), etc., the Linux kernel module `softdog` will be used to force a shutdown to avoid split-brain.

**Recovering from this situation**

When Patroni dies violently, first manually shut down the original PostgreSQL Primary that is managed by it and still running, then restarts Patroni again and have the PostgreSQL instance pulled up by Patroni.

```bash
/usr/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /pg/data stop
systemctl restart patroni
```

If not, an error may occur where Patroni does not start properly.

```bash
2021-12-03 14:16:18 +0800 INFO:  stderr=2021-12-03 14:16:18.752 HKT [7852] FATAL:  lock file "postPrimary.pid" already exists
2021-12-03 14:16:18.752 HKT [7852] HINT:  Is another postPrimary (PID 887) running in data directory "/pg/data"?
```



> Explanation of parameter [`patroni_watchdog_mode`](v-pgsql.md#patroni_watchdog_mode).
>
> * If mode is `required` but `/dev/watchdog` is not available, it will not affect Patroni startup, only the leadership candidacy of the current instance.
> * If the mode is `required`, but `/dev/watchdog` is not available. The instance cannot be a qualified Primary candidate, i.e., it cannot participate in Failover, even if manually forced to specify it: a `Switchover failed, details: 412, switchover is not possible: no good candidates have been found` error. To solve this problem, change the `patroni_watchdog` option in the `/pg/bin/patroni.yml` file to `automatic|off`.
> * If the mode is `automatic`, there is no restriction, and the instance will be able to run in the Primary election regardless of whether `/dev/watchdog` is available or not.
> * Two conditions are required for `/dev/watchdog` to be available, the `softdog` kernel module is loaded, and `/dev/watchdog` is owned by `postgres` (dbsu).





### 5A-Primary DCS Agent is not available

In this case, the Patroni on the Primary will demote itself to a normal Replica because it cannot connect to the DCS service. However, if the Replica Patroni is still aware that the Primary is alive (e.g., streaming replication is still going on normally), it does not trigger Failover!

In this case, Pigsty's access mechanism will **cause the whole cluster to enter a Primaryless state and be unwritable because the original Primary node health check is false**!


In maintenance mode, no changes.

## Replica node failure experiment

### 1B-Replica node down

**Operating Instructions**

```bash
ssh 10.10.10.3 sudo reboot    # Reboot the pg-test-1 Primary node directly (VIP points to the actual Primary node)
```

**Operation Result**

A Replica node going down will cause services such as `HAPorxy`, `Patroni`, `Postgres`, etc., on that node to become unavailable. Usually, the business side will notice a minimal number of transient error reports (the connection to the failed instance will be broken), and then the other LBs in the cluster will take this failed node off the backend list.

Note that if the cluster is one Primary & one Replica and the only Replica is down, the offline query service may be affected (no available bearer instances).

Once the node restart is complete, the Patroni service will automatically pull up, and the instance will automatically rejoin the cluster.



### 2B-Replica node Postgres process shutdown

**Operating Instructions**

Two different ways of shutting down the Replica Postgres instance: regular `pg_ctl` and brute-force `kill -9`.

```bash
# Shut down the Postgres Primary process on the Replica node
ssh 10.10.10.3 'sudo -iu postgres /usr/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /pg/data stop'

# Query the Replica PID and force Kill
ssh 10.10.10.3 'sudo kill -9 $(sudo cat /pg/data/postPrimary.pid | head -n1)'
```

**Operation Results**

After shutting down Postgres, Patroni tries to pull up the Postgres process again. If successful, the cluster returns to normal. If the Replica goes down causes the health check for that instance to be Down, the cluster's LB will not redistribute traffic to that instance, and a few transient errors will be reported for application read-only requests.

## DCS Failure Experiment

### 1C-DCS Server is completely unavailable

**DCS is completely unavailable is a severe failure that will cause all database clusters to be unwritable by default**. If L2 VIP access is used, the L2 VIP bound to the Primary node is also unavailable by default, resulting in the entire cluster being potentially unreadable!

DCS can solve this problem: by using a distributed architecture with a reliable disaster recovery mechanism. For example, a 3-node DCS cluster allows one server to fail, while a 5-node DCS cluster allows up to two server nodes to fall simultaneously.



After shutting down Consul, **all** database cluster Primary with HA auto-switchover mode enabled to trigger the demotion logic (because the Patroni of the Primary are not aware of the presence of other cluster members and have to assume that the other Replicas already constitute a quorum majority of the partition and are elected, thus demoting themselves as Replicas to avoid split-brain).

**Operating Instructions**

Shut down the DCS Server on the meta node, at least two if three and at least three if there are 5.

```bash
systemctl stop consul
```

### Solution

1. In maintenance mode, the user loses the ability to automatically Failover, but a DCS failure will not cause the Primary node to be unwritable. (fast manual switchover is still possible).
2. Use more DCS instances to ensure DCS availability (DCS itself was created to solve this problem).
3. Configure a long enough timeout retry time for Patroni and set the highest response priority for DCS failures.



### 2C-DCS pass Primary, not a Replica (1 Primary, 1 Replica)


### 3C-DCS pass Primary, no Replica (1 Primary n Replica, n>1)


### 4C-DCS pass Replica, not pass Primary (1 Primary, 1 Replica)


### 5C-DCS pass Replica, no Primary (1 Primary n Replica, n>1)


### 6C-DCS network jitter: simultaneous outages, Primary and Replica recover at the same time, or Primary recovers first


### 7C-DCS network jitter: simultaneous interruption, Replica recovers first, Primary recovers later (1 Primary, 1 Replica)


### 8C-DCS network jitter: simultaneous interruption, Replica recovers first, Primary recovers later (1 Primary n Replica, n>1)
