# Concept: Nodes

> Pigsty use **nodes** for deployment, nodes cloud be physical machines, VMs, or even Pods.



Pigsty has two types of nodes: [meta node](#Meta-Node) and (normal) [node](#node).

Meta nodes are used to initiate control, and (normal) nodes are managed under control.

* [Meta node](#Meta-Node): Run [`infra.yml`](p-infra.md) playbook to install Pigsty, **INFRA**, **NODES**, and **PGSQL** modules.
* [Node](#node): Run [`nodes.yml`](p-nodes.md#nodes) playbook to join Pigsty, and install the **NODES** module by default.



## Meta Node

Meta-Nodes are nodes installed with Pigsty, with admin capability and a complete [infra](c-infra.md) set.

Current node are marked as meta during  `./configure`, populated in the `meta` group of [inventory](v-config.md).

Pigsty requires at least one meta node per environment. It will be used as a command center for the entire environment. It's the meta node's responsibility to keep states, manage configs, launch plays, run tasks, and collect metrics & logs. The infra set is deployed on meta nodes by default: Nginx, Grafana, Prometheus, Alertmanager, NTP, DNS Nameserver, and DCS.



### Reuse Meta Node

**The meta node can also be reused as a common node**, and a PostgreSQL cluster named `pg-meta` is created by default on the meta. Supporting additional features: CMDB, routine tasks report, extended apps, log analysis & data analysis, etc.

Taking Pigsty [Sandbox](d-sandbox.md) as an example, the distribution of components on the nodes is shown below.

The sandbox consists of a [meta node](#Meta-Node) with 4 [nodes](#node). The sandbox is deployed with one set of [infra](c-infra.md) and 2 [database clusters](c-pgsql.md#cluster). `meta` is the meta node, deployed with **infra** and reused as a regular node, deployed with meta DB cluster `pg-meta`. `node-1`, `node-2`, and `node-3` are normal nodes deployed with cluster `pg-test`.



### Meta Node Service

The services running on the meta node are shown below.

### Meta Node & DCS

By default, DCS Servers (Consul or Etcd) will be deployed on the meta nodes, or you can use **External DCS Cluster**. Any infra outside DCS will be deployed on the meta node as a peer-to-peer copy. The number of meta nodes requires a minimum of 1, recommends 3, and recommends no more than 5.

!> DCS Servers are used for leader election in HA Scenarios. **Shutting down the DCS servers will demote ALL clusters, which reject any writes by default!** So make sure you have enough availability on these DCS Servers, at least stronger than PostgreSQL itself. It's recommended to add more meta nodes or use an external independently maintained, HA DCS cluster for production-grade deployment.



### Multiple Meta Nodes

Usually, one meta node is sufficient for basic usage, two meta nodes can be used as standby backup, and 3 meta nodes can support a minimal meaningful production-grade DCS Servers themselves!

Pigsty will set DCS Servers on all meta nodes by default for the sake of "Battery-Included". But it's meaningless to have more than 3 meta nodes. If you are seeking HA DCS Servies. Using an external DCS Cluster with 3~5 nodes would be more appropriate.

Meta nodes are configured under `all.children.meta.host` in the [inventory](v-config.md). They will be marked with `meta_node: true` flag. The node runs `configure` will be marked as meta, and multiple meta nodes have to be configured manually, check  [`pigsty-dcs3.yml`](https://github.com/Vonng/pigsty/files/conf/pigsty-dcs3.yml) for example.

If you are not using any external DCS as an arbiter. It requires at least 3 nodes to form a meaningful HA Cluster that allows one node failure. 



## Node

You can manage more nodes with Pigsty, and use them to deploy various databases or your applications.

The nodes managed by Pigsty are adjusted by [`nodes.yml`](p-nodes.md#nodes) to the state described by [Config: NODES](v-nodes.md), and the node monitoring and log collection components are installed so you can check the node status and logs from the monitoring system.



### Node Identity

Each node has [identity parameters](v-nodes.md#NODE_IDENTITY) that are configured by parameters in `<cluster>.hosts` and `<cluster>.vars`.

There are two important node identity parameters: [`nodename`](v-nodes.md#nodename) and [`node_cluster`](v-nodes.md#node_cluster), which will be used as the node's **instance identity** (`ins`) and **cluster identity** (`cls`)  in the monitoring system. [`nodename`](v-nodes.md#nodename) and [`node_cluster`](v-nodes.md#node_cluster) are NOT **REQUIRED** since they all have proper default values: Hostname and constant `nodes`.

Besides, Pigsty uses an **IP address** as a unique node identifier, too. Which is the `inventory_hostname`  reflected as the `key` in the `<cluster>.hosts` object. A node may have multiple interfaces & IP addresses. But you must explicitly designate one as the **PRIMARY IP ADDRESS**. **Which should be an intranet IP for service access**. It's not mandatory to use that same IP address to ssh from the meta node, you can use ssh tunnel & jump server with  [`Ansible Connect`](v-infra.md#CONNECT) parameters.

|                   Name                    |   Type   | Level | Attribute    | Description           |
| :---------------------------------------: | :------: | :---: | ------------ | --------------------- |
|           `inventory_hostname`            |   `ip`   | **-** | **REQUIRED** | **Node IP**           |
|     [`nodename`](v-nodes.md#nodename)     | `string` | **I** | Optional     | **Node Name**         |
| [`node_cluster`](v-nodes.md#node_cluster) | `string` | **C** | Optional     | **Node Cluster Name** |

The following cluster configuration declares a three-node cluster.

```yaml
node-test:
  hosts:
    10.10.10.11: { nodename: node-test-1 }
    10.10.10.12: { pg_hostname: true } # Borrowed identity pg-test-2
    10.10.10.13: {  } # Use the original hostname: node-3
  vars:
    node_cluster: node-test
```

|     host      | node_cluster |   nodename    |  instance   |
| :-----------: | :----------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| `10.10.10.11` | `node-test`  | `node-test-1` | `pg-test-1` |
| `10.10.10.12` | `node-test`  |  `pg-test-2`  | `pg-test-2` |
| `10.10.10.13` | `node-test`  |   `node-3`    | `pg-test-3` |

IIn the monitoring system, the time-series monitoring data are labeled as follows.

```json
node_load1{cls="pg-meta", ins="pg-meta-1", ip="10.10.10.10", job="nodes"}
node_load1{cls="pg-test", ins="pg-test-1", ip="10.10.10.11", job="nodes"}
node_load1{cls="pg-test", ins="pg-test-2", ip="10.10.10.12", job="nodes"}
node_load1{cls="pg-test", ins="pg-test-3", ip="10.10.10.13", job="nodes"}
```

### PGSQL Node

A **PGSQL Node** is a node with a [PGSQL](c-pgsql.md) module installed.

Pigsty uses **exclusively** deploy policy for PGSQL. This means the node's identity and pgsql's identity are exchangeable.  The [`pg_hostname`](v-pgsql.md#pg_hostname) parameter is designed to assign the Postgres identity to its underlying node: `pg_instance` and `pg_cluster` will be assigned to the node's [`nodename`](v-nodes.md#nodename) & [`node_cluster`](v-nodes.md#node_cluster).

In addition to [node default services](#node-services), the following services are available on PGSQL nodes.

|     Component      | Port | Description                                                |

## Node Interaction

Here's an example of interactions between a meta node & a common node.

![](_media/ARCH.gif)

The interaction between the meta node and common nodes are:

* Database cluster/node domain name resolved by Nameserver on meta node. (optional)
* Database node software **installation** will use Yum Repo on meta.
* Prometheus collects database cluster/node monitoring **metrics** on meta.
* Database logs are collected by Promtail and sent to Loki.
* Pigsty will control database nodes from the meta node:
  * Cluster creation, scale in / scale out, instance/cluster recycling
  * Creating business users & databases, modifying services routes & HBA rules.
  * Log collection, vacuum analyze, backup, and other routine tasks, etc.
* Node's Consul will sync locally registered services to the DCS Servers.
* The database node will synchronize time from the meta node (or other NTP server).
