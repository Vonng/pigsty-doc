## Distribution


**Distribution** refers to the overall solution consisting of a kernel and peripheral software packages. For example, Linux is an OS kernel, while RedHat, Debian, and SUSE are OS distributions based on Linux kernel.

Pigsty is an entire **solution** for using postgres in your production environment. It will setup everything for your with one-click:
creating & scaling clusters, switchover & auto failover. manage databases, users, roles, hbas, schemas, hbas with configuration, connection pooling, load balancing, monitoring & logging & alerting, service discovery, etc...

## Monitoring

PostgreSQL is the most advanced open source relational database, but its ecosystem lacks a open source monitoring system which is **good enough**. Pigsty aims to solve this by delivering the best **Open Source Monitoring Solution for PostgreSQL**.

![](_media/overview-monitor.jpg)

Pigsty comes with a professional-grade PostgreSQL monitoring system which is specially designed for large-scale postgres cluster management. Including 1200+ metrics, 20+ Dashboards, thousands of panels which covering detailed information from the biggest overview to the smallest individual object. Which brings irreplaceable value for professional users.

Pigsty consists of three monitor apps: `pgsql`, which focus on time-series metrics. `pgcat`, which explores database catalog directly. And `pglog`, which collect realtime logs from postgres, patroni and pgbouncer, and visualize csvlog samples. More will come later.

Pigsty is build upon popular open source components such as Prometheus & Grafana. There's no vendor locking, and the infra can be easily reused for other purpose.


## Provisioning

PostgreSQL cluster comes before monitoring system. That's why pigsty is shipping with a handy **Provisioning Solution**.
It allows you to create, update, scale, and manage your postgres cluster in kubernetes style: Describe what your want and pigsty will just do that for ya.

For example, creating a one-leader-with-two-replica cluster `pg-test` on three nodes requires only a few lines of configuration, and one command `pgsql.yml -l pg-test` to instantiate it.


```yaml
pg-test:
  hosts:
    10.10.10.11: {pg_seq: 1, pg_role: primary}
    10.10.10.12: {pg_seq: 2, pg_role: replica}
    10.10.10.13: {pg_seq: 3, pg_role: replica}
  vars: 
    pg_cluster: pg-test
    vip_address: 10.10.10.3
```

## HA Clusters


The clusters created by Pigsty are **distributed** HA postgres database cluster powered by Patroni & HAProxy.
As long as any instance in the cluster survives, the cluster serves. Each instance is idempotent from application's point of view.

## Sandbox

Pigsty is designed for real world production env with hundreds of high spec nodes, but it can also run inside a tiny 1C|1GB vm node.
Which is great for developing, testing, demonstrating, data analysing & visualizing and other purposes.

Pigsty sandbox can be pulled up with one command on your Macbook, powered by virtualbox & vagrant.
There are two specs of sandbox: 1 node (the default) and 4 node (full sandbox)

![](_media/sandbox.svg)

<details>
<summary>Sandbox Specification</summary>

**System Requirement**

* CentOS 7 / Red Hat 7 / Oracle Linux 7 or equivalent
* CentOS 7.8.2003 x86_64 is highly recommend (fully tested under production)

**Minimal Spec**

* Self-contained, single meta node, singleton pgsql cluster `pg-meta`
* Minimal requirement: 1 CPU Core & 2 GB RAM

**Demo setup ( TINY mode, vagrant demo)**

* 4 Node, including single meta node, singleton database cluster `pg-meta` and 3-instances pgsql cluster `pg-test`
* Spec:  2Core/4GB for meta controller node, 1Core/1GB for database node (x3)

**Production setup (OLTP/OLAP/CRIT mode)**

* 3 meta nodes , up to 100+ database clusters or 400~500 nodes
* Verified Spec: Dell R740 / 64 Core / 400GB Mem / 3TB PCI-E SSD

</details>



## Analysis

Pigsty ships with handy tools such as Jupyterlab, PostgreSQL, Grafana, Echarts. Which is great for data analysis & visualization.
You can turn pigsty sandbox into an IDE for making data-intensive applications and demos: Processing data with SQL & Python, Visualize with Grafana & Echarts.

Pigsty comes with two example apps: `covid` for covid-19 data visualization, and `isd` for visualizing global surface weather station data.

## Get Started

It takes 3 commands to pull up pigsty: **download**, **configure**, **install**

![](_media/how.svg)


Get a fresh Linux x86_64 CentOS 7.8 node. with nopass `sudo` & `ssh` access, then:

```bash
# curl -SL https://github.com/Vonng/pigsty/releases/download/v1.0.0/pigsty.tgz -o ~/pigsty.tgz  
# curl -SL https://github.com/Vonng/pigsty/releases/download/v1.0.0/pkg.tgz    -o /tmp/pkg.tgz
git clone https://github.com/Vonng/pigsty && cd pigsty
./configure
make install
```

Check [Quick Start](s-install.md) for detail. 

If you don't have vm nodes, considering launch pigsty [sandbox](s-sandbox.md) on your Macbook:

```bash
make deps      # Install MacOS deps with homebrew
make dns       # Write static DNS
make start     # Pull-up vm nodes and setup ssh access  (start4 for 4-node demo)
make demo      # install pigsty on 'meta' as above      (demo4  for 4-node demo) 
```
